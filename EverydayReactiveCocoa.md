### Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a programming paradigm for reactive programming using the building blocks of functional programming. - Wikipedia

# Inputs and Ouputs 

### "Programs take input and produce output. The output is the result of doing something with the input. Input, transform, output, done."

### "The output at any one time is the result of combining all inputs. The output is a function of all inputs up to that time." - Josh Abernathy

# Inputs

* Keyboard (text) input
* Click/Touches (mouse, finger) input
* Timers (intervals)
* Location changes
* Data from webservices
* Images from webservices

---

# Outputs

* Display
* Sounds
* Persist data somewhere
* Push data to the cloud

---

# Why

* Minimal App State
* Declarative
* Expressive
* Different ...

# ReactiveCocoa
## Reactive Functional Programming framework by Github

---

# RACSignal is the king!

---

# RAC for KVO (RACObserver) produces a signal

---

# RAC macro for binding a signal to a property

---

# RAC for handling selectors etc

---

# RAC helpers for generating signals from controls

---

# Real Power is combing and chaining signals

### Build the Pipeline
